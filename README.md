This is my solution to the first programming assignment of the **CSE 3218** course named **Mobile Computing Laboratory** at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology and which you can attend via the iTunesU app on your iPad/iPhone.


## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Easily convert numbers to percentages.
- **Sign Inversion**: Toggle the sign of numbers.
- **Clear Function**: Quickly reset the calculator.
- **Decimal Support**: Handle decimal numbers in calculations.
- **User-friendly UI**: A clean and intuitive interface designed with SwiftUI.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both iPhone and iPad screens.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The programming language used to build the app.
- **SwiftUI**: A framework for building the user interface.

## Core Logic

### Button Actions

- **AC**: Clears all inputs and resets the calculator.
- **+/-**: Inverts the sign of the current input number.
- **%**: Converts the current input number to a percentage.
- **Arithmetic Operators (/ x - +)**: Sets the operation and prepares for the next input.
- **=**: Calculates the result based on the current operation and inputs.
- **Decimal Point**: Allows for decimal number input.
- **Number Buttons**: Appends the pressed number to the current input.

- 
### Calculation Logic

- **First Number Storage**: Stores the first number when an operation button is pressed.
- **Second Number Storage**: Stores the second number when the equals button is pressed.
- **Operation Handling**: Performs the arithmetic operation when the equals button is pressed and displays the result.
